## 🔐 Gmail Access & Privacy

SubSentry uses **Gmail read-only access** to detect subscription-related emails.

- ✔ Can read email content
- ❌ Cannot send emails
- ❌ Cannot delete or modify emails

**Scope used:**

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
```

We never store email content permanently and never access emails without user consent.
